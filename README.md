# work-day-schedule
I created a work day schedule that allows users to add events to each business hour of the day. Each hour is in a color coded row that corresponds to whether that hour has passed, is the current hour, or is in the future. The current date is displayed at the top of the page. When users input an event into the text area for a particular hour, that event is stored in local storage and will appear again when the page is refreshed.
